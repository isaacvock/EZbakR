<p>The goal of most standard, single label, NR-seq experiments is to
assess the kinetics of RNA synthesis and degradation. In EZbakR, this is
the task of <code><a href="../reference/EstimateKinetics.html">EstimateKinetics()</a></code>. This vignette will discuss
the basics of the standard analysis implemented by
<code><a href="../reference/EstimateKinetics.html">EstimateKinetics()</a></code>, and touch on two alternative analysis
strategies that <code><a href="../reference/EstimateKinetics.html">EstimateKinetics()</a></code> also implements:
non-steady-state and short-feed analyses.</p>

<p>Setting <code>strategy = "standard"</code> is not strictly necessary,
but I do it here to highlight that this is an argument that you can
alter. If you have multiple <code>fractions</code> tables, then you will
need to specify aspects of the metadata of the table you want to use.
Under the hood, EZbakR is passing these arguments to
<code><a href="../reference/EZget.html">EZget()</a></code>, so check out the vignette on <code><a href="../reference/EZget.html">EZget()</a></code>
to better understand how this works:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>In this case, <code>repeatID</code> has to be specified because the
two fractions table present are identical in all other metadata aspects.
Other metadata that you can specify are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>features</code>: Set of features analyzed, or a subset of
features unique to the table of interest.</li>
<li>
<code>populations</code>: Mutation populations analyzed. Relevant if
one of the tables is from a single-label analysis, and the other is from
a multi-label analysis. <code><a href="../reference/EstimateKinetics.html">EstimateKinetics()</a></code>’s standard
analysis strategy is only compatible with single-label analyses.</li>
<li>
<code>fraction_design</code>: The fraction design table used for the
analysis of interest. Rarely will be necessary to specify in this
case.</li>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-is-the-standard-strategy">What is the “standard” strategy?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-the-standard-strategy"></a>
</h3>
<p>The standard strategy makes the following assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You have conducted a pulse-label experiment. That means, cells were
labeled for a period of time that I will refer to as the label time, and
RNA was extracted after this labeling. This is in contrast to a
pulse-chase design, where you label for a certain amount of time (the
pulse time) and then chase with regular nucleotide for a certain amount
of time (the chase time). Eventually, EZbakR will support kinetic
parameter inference from a pulse-chase design, but I will say more about
that at the end of this vignette.</li>
<li>All of the populations of RNA you analyzed were at steady-state
during the course of metabolic labeling. This means that their levels
were constant and not changing in response to some perturbation during
the labeling.</li>
<li>RNA synthesis is a 0-th order, constant rate process, and RNA
degradation is a 1st-order, single rate constant process.</li>
</ol>
<p>If all of these assumptions are met, then the dynamics of a given RNA
population are well described by the following differential
equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\frac{\text{dR}}{\text{dt}} = k_{\text{syn}} - k_{\text{deg}}*\text{R}
\end{align}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\text{R}\)</span> represents
the concentration of RNA over time and <span class="math inline">\(k_{\text{syn}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_{\text{deg}}\)</span> are the synthesis and
degradation rate constants, respectively. The general solution to this
differential equation is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\text{R(t)} = \frac{ k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}}
+  (\text{R}_\text{o} - \frac{ k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}})*
e^{-\text{tl}*k_{\text{deg}}}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\text{R}_\text{o}\)</span> is the
initial concentration of the RNA and <span class="math inline">\(\text{tl}\)</span> is the label time. Thus the
concentration of new RNA (<span class="math inline">\(\text{R}_\text{o}
= 0\)</span>) as a function of time is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\text{R}_{\text{new}}\text{(t)} = \frac{
k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}}*(1 - e^{-\text{tl}*k_{\text{deg}}})
\end{align}
\]</span> As we are assuming that the total RNA concentration is not
changing during the labeling, and since the steady-state concentration
of RNA (solve for R setting <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{dR}}{\text{dt}} = 0\)</span>) is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{ k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}}\)</span>,
we get that the fraction of RNA that is new (denoted <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\theta = 1 - e^{-\text{tl}*k_{\text{deg}}}
\end{align}
\]</span> We can thus solve for the degradation rate constant, and use
the normalized read counts to infer the synthesis rate constant.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
k_{\text{deg}} &amp;= -\frac{\text{log}(1 - \theta)}{\text{tl}} \\
k_{\text{syn}} &amp;= (\text{normalized read count})*k_{\text{deg}}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: degradation rate constants estimated in this
manner will be in absolute units (1/time), whereas synthesis rate
constants will be in relative units (read counts/time). Thus,
degradation rate constant estimation is “internally normalized” (the
fraction new is a ratio of two unnormalized quantities that would have
the same normalization scale factor), whereas synthesis rate constant
estimates require normalization across libraries and samples. At this
stage, EZbakR uses TMM normalization (as in packages like edgeR and
DESeq2) to calculate the normalized read counts. In the near future, it
will also support users providing external scale factors (e.g., those
derived from spike-ins).</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="short-feed-analyses">Short feed analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#short-feed-analyses"></a>
</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is advantageous to use a fairly short label time. For
example, NR-seq is commonly used as a replacement for enrichment based
metabolic labeling methods (e.g., TT-seq), and a short label time is
used to ensure that there is limited degradation of newly synthesized
RNA during the feed. EZbakR formalizes this strategy and provides a way
by which to estimate synthesis and degradation rate constants in this
context.</p>
<div class="section level3">

<p>Everything is the same as it was in the standard case, except now we
set <code>strategy = "shortfeed"</code>:</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-shortfeed-strategy">What is the “shortfeed” strategy?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-the-shortfeed-strategy"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the case of an extremely short label feed time (relative to the
average half-life of RNA being analyzed), we can assume that there is no
degradation newly synthesized RNA during the label time. Thus, the
following differential equation and solution to said ODE describes the
dynamics of the new RNA:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\frac{\text{dR}}{\text{dt}} &amp;= k_{\text{syn}} \\
\text{R}_{\text{new}}\text{(t)} &amp;=  k_{\text{syn}}*\text{t}
\end{align}
\]</span> Assuming that the concentration of new RNA is proportional to
the normalized number of new reads yields the following estimate for
<span class="math inline">\(k_{\text{syn}}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
k_{\text{syn}} =  \frac{\theta*(\text{normalized read
count})}{\text{tl}}
\]</span> Assuming the RNA levels are at steady-state (as in the
standard analysis), yields the following estimate for the degradation
rate constant:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\text{normalized read count} &amp;=
\frac{k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}} \\
k_{\text{deg}} &amp;= \frac{k_{\text{syn}}}{\text{normalized read
count}} \\
k_{\text{deg}} &amp;= \frac{\theta}{\text{tl}}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The calculus enthusiasts among you may recognize that this estimate
for <span class="math inline">\(k_{\text{deg}}\)</span> is equivalent to
a 1st order Taylor series approximation of the “standard” estimate
strategy. This is no coincidence, as the assumption of a short feed is
equivalent to assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>
is close to 0 (most of the RNA is old). It may also seem odd that this
estimate is bound to be between 0 and 1/tl, but this just reflects the
assumption made by this strategy that RNA half lives are much shorter
than the label time.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="non-steady-state-nss-analyses">Non-steady-state (NSS) analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#non-steady-state-nss-analyses"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The strategy described here is a slight
modification of that discussed in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276521004962" class="external-link">Narain
et al., 2021</a>. If you use EZbakR’s “NSS” strategy, please cite that
paper as well as EZbakR.</p>
<p>One of the key assumptions made by the “standard” analysis strategy
is the assumption that RNA levels are at steady-state during the
labeling. This assumption can be violated if a perturbation was applied
to cells shortly before the start of, or during, labeling. It can also
be violated if you are studying a process (e.g., development) where the
state of the cells is changing over the course of the experiment.
<code>EstimateKinetic()</code> can adjust its kinetic parameter
estimation strategy accordingly, though it requires making some
assumptions about how the experiment was performed. See below for
details</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="requirements-of-the-nss-strategy">Requirements of the “NSS” strategy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#requirements-of-the-nss-strategy"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this case, it is important to discuss some key aspects about how
this strategy works before showcasing it. Namely:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Instead of assuming the fraction new in a given sample is related to
the degradation rate constant, EZbakR will compare the old read levels
in the labeled sample and a control from the start of the labeling.</li>
<li>EZbakR assumes that -label data (i.e., data collected from unlabeled
cells) was collected at a time point equivalent to the start of
labeling. This means that read counts from a given set of -label
replicates provides information about the starting levels of RNA.</li>
<li>Technically, you could also perform an NSS-style analysis if the end
of a given set of labeled time points represents the start of the next
set of labeled time points. EZbakR does not currently support
NSS-analyses in this case, but it eventually will.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="how-to-run-it-1">How to run it<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-run-it-1"></a>
</h3>
<p>The only difference in this case is that you have to tell EZbakR
which -label samples to use as a reference for the initial
concentrations of RNA. This is done by specicfying the
<code>grouping_factors</code> parameter, which denotes the metadf
columns that -label samples should be stratified by. In other words, old
RNA levels in +label samples will be compared to total RNA levels in
-label samples with the same metadf values for all of the
<code>grouping_factors</code> columns specified:</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-nss-strategy">What is the “NSS” strategy?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-the-nss-strategy"></a>

<p>You can see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276521004962" class="external-link">Narain
et al.</a> for an alternative discussion of this strategy.</p>
<p>We would like to relax the assumption that the total RNA levels are
unchanging over the course of the labeling. We can do this by
considering the dynamics of the old RNA during the labeling. If we
assume that a single, unchanging degradation rate constant describes
their turnover, then the following ODE and solution describe its
dynamics:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\frac{\text{dR}}{\text{dt}} &amp;= -k_{\text{deg}}*\text{R} \\
\text{R}_{\text{old}}\text{(t)}
&amp;=  \text{R}_{\text{o}}*e^{-k_{\text{deg}}*\text{t}}
\end{align}
\]</span> In the steady-state case, <span class="math inline">\(\text{R}_{\text{o}}\)</span> would be equivalent
to the steady-state RNA level (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{
k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}}\)</span>). In the away from steady-state
case though, this assumption is no longer valid. Despite this, assume
for a second that we could estimate <span class="math inline">\(\text{R}_{\text{o}}\)</span>. Under this
assumption, we could then estimate <span class="math inline">\(k_{\text{deg}}\)</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
k_{\text{deg}} =
-\frac{\text{log}(\text{R}_{\text{old}}\text{(t)}/\text{R}_{\text{o}})}{\text{tl}}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can then return to the general solution of the differential
equation described in the ‘standard’ analysis strategy section:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
\text{R(t)} &amp;= \frac{ k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}}
+  (\text{R}_\text{o} - \frac{ k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}})*
e^{-\text{tl}*k_{\text{deg}}} \\
\text{R}_{\text{new}}\text{(t)} &amp;= \frac{
k_{\text{syn}}}{k_{\text{deg}}}*(1 - e^{-\text{tl}*k_{\text{deg}}})
\end{align}
\]</span> where in the second line we set <span class="math inline">\(\text{R}_\text{o} = 0\)</span> as there was no new
RNA at the start of labeling, and derive an estimator for <span class="math inline">\(k_{\text{syn}}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
k_{\text{syn}} = \frac{\theta*(\text{normalized read
count)}*k_{\text{deg}}}{1 - e^{-k_{\text{deg}}*\text{tl}}}
\]</span> This yields the same estimator as in the steady-state case
when <span class="math inline">\(\theta = 1 -
e^{-k_{\text{deg}}*\text{tl}}\)</span></p>
<p>One thing you may be wondering is just how much of non-steady-state
analysis this really is if we are still assuming constant rate
constants? What if the rates of synthesis and degradation are being
actively modulated by the cell during the label time? I won’t present a
detailed proof here, but it turns out that the strategy laid out above
is the best that you can do. In the case where rate constants are
changing during the label time, you can think of the estimates from this
strategy as time averages of the true rate constants, averaged over the
labeling period.</p>

<p>The infrastructure is in place for EZbakR to support pulse-chase
analyses of kinetic parmaeters (e.g., metadf can accept specification of
a pulse and chase time). Thus, in the future, EZbakR will provide such
support. That being said, I would like to take some time to argue
against <em>almost</em> ever doing a pulse-chase NR-seq experiment.
Pulse-chase experimental designs suffer from a number of shortcomings
and are almost never necessary in NR-seq experiments.</p>
<p>There are many classic examples of pulse-chase experimental designs
being used to assess the kinetics of RNA metabolism. In these cases
though, the point of the pulse was to create a species of RNA whose
dynamics are completely driven by the degradation kinetics of the RNA.
For example, the pioneering studies from the Parker lab elucidating the
mechanisms of RNA degradation involved pulsing with a particular
nutrient to stimulate transcription of a construct. The chase then
washed out that nutrient to shut off transcription from the construct,
meaning that RNA produced from it will exclusively degrade post-chase.
When you pulse with a metabolic label like s<sup>4</sup>U though, you
have already created a species of RNA whose dynamics are completely
degradation driven: the unlabeled RNA. Following the metabolic label
pulse with a nucleotide chase is thus redundant, switching the
degradation driven population from the unlabeled RNA to the labeled
RNA.</p>
<p>In addition, pulse-chase experiments often necessitate extensive
exposure of your cells to the metabolic label, which increases the
possibility of cytotoxic effects of metabolic label. Finally, analysis
of pulse-chase experiments is more complicated than a pulse-label
design. To estimate the kinetics of degradation, you need to know what
fraction of the RNA for each feature of interest was labeled after the
pulse. This means that estimating the synthesis and degradation kinetics
requires two separate samples, RNA extracted after the pulse and RNA
extracted after the chase. With the pulse alone, you can get all of the
information that you can get with both though!! You want multiple time
points? Just do multiple pulses. Pulse-labels are easier to perform and
easier to analyze than pulse-chases.</p>
