Description: A complete rewrite and reimagination of bakR. Designed to support
	a wide array of analyses of nucleotide recoding RNA-seq (NR-seq) datasets of any
	type. Specifially designed with the following NR-seq methods in mind: TimeLapse-seq/
	SLAM-seq/TUC-seq, Start-TimeLapse-seq (STL-seq), TT-TimeLapse-seq (TT-TL-seq), TILAC,
	subcellular TimeLapse-seq. Support for single cell NR-seq methods is provided though
	may be expanded in the future. Also designed to support nucleotide specific mutational
	analyses and thus analyses of any mutational probing RNA-seq method (SHAPE-seq, DMS-MaPseq,
	TRIBE, DART-seq, etc.).
