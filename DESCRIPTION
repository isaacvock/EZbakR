Description: A complete rewrite and reimagining of bakR (see 'Vock et al.' (2025) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013179>).
  Designed to support a wide array of analyses of nucleotide recoding RNA-seq (NR-seq) datasets of any
	type, including TimeLapse-seq/SLAM-seq/TUC-seq, Start-TimeLapse-seq (STL-seq),
	TT-TimeLapse-seq (TT-TL-seq), and subcellular NR-seq. EZbakR extends
	standard NR-seq standard NR-seq mutational modeling to support multi-label analyses
	(e.g., 4sU and 6sG dual labeling), and implements an improved hierarchical model to better
	account for transcript-to-transcript variance in metabolic label incorporation.
	EZbakR also generalized dynamical systems modeling of NR-seq data to support analyses
	of premature mRNA processing and flow between subcellular compartments. Finally,
	EZbakR implements flexible and well-powered comparative analyses of all
	estimated parameters via design matrix-specified generalized linear modeling.
