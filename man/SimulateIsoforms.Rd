\arguments{
\item{nfeatures}{Number of "features" to simulate data for. Each feature will
have a simulated number of transcript isoforms}

\item{nt}{(Optional), can provide a vector of the number of isoforms you would
like to simulate for each of the \code{nfeatures} features. Vector can either be length
1, in which case that many isoforms will be simulated for all features, or length
equal to \code{nfeatures}.}

\item{seqdepth}{Total number of sequencing reads to simulate}

\item{label_time}{Length of s^{4}U feed to simulate.}

\item{sample_name}{Character vector to assign to \code{sample} column of output simulated
data table (the cB table).}

\item{feature_prefix}{Name given to the i-th feature is \code{paste0(feature_prefix, i)}. Shows up in the
\code{feature} column of the output simulated data table.}

\item{pnew}{Probability that a T is mutated to a C if a read is new.}

\item{pold}{Probability that a T is mutated to a C if a read is old.}

\item{readlength}{Length of simulated reads. In this simple simulation, all reads
are simulated as being exactly this length.}

\item{Ucont}{Probability that a nucleotide in a simulated read is a U.}

\item{avg_numiso}{Average number of isoforms for each feature. Feature-specific
isoform counts are drawn from a Poisson distribution with this average. NOTE:
to insure that all features have multiple isoforms, the simulated number of
isoforms drawn from a Poisson distribution is incremented by 2. Thus, the
actual average number of isoforms from each feature is \code{avg_numiso} + 2.}

\item{psynthdiff}{Percentage of genes for which all isoform abundance differences
are synthesis driven. If not synthesis driven, then isoform abundance differences
will be driven by differences in isoform kdegs.}

\item{logkdeg_mean}{meanlog of a log-normal distribution from which
kdegs are simulated}

\item{logkdeg_sd}{sdlog of a log-normal distribution from which
kdegs are simulated}

\item{logksyn_mean}{meanlog of a log-normal distribution from which
ksyns are simulated}

\item{logksyn_sd}{sdlog of a log-normal distribution from which
ksyns are simulated}
}
\description{
\code{SimulateIsoforms()} performs a simple simulation of isoform-specific kinetic
parameters to showcase and test \code{EstimateIsoformFractions()}. It assumes that
there are a set of reads (fraction of total set by \code{funique} parameter) which
map uniquely to a given isoform, while the rest are ambiguous to all isoforms
from that gene. Mutational content of these reads are simulated as in
\code{SimulateOneRep()}.
