\usage{
EZbakRKinetics(kinetics, metadf, features, name = NULL, character_limit = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{kinetics}{Data frame with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item sample: Name given to particular sample from which data was collected.
\item features: Any columns that cannot be interpreted as a mutation count
or base nucleotide count (and that aren't named \code{sample} or \code{n}) will be
interpreted as an ID for a genomic "feature" from which a read originated.
Common examples of features and typical column names for said features include:
\itemize{
\item Genes; common column names: gene, gene_id, gene_name, GF
\item Genes-exonic; common column names: gene_exon, gene_id_exon, gene_name_exon, XF
\item Transcripts; common column names: transcripts, TF
\item Exonic bins; common column names: exonic_bins, EF, EB
\item Exons; common column names: exons, exon_ids
}
In some cases, a read will often map to multiple features (e.g., exons). Many
functions in bakR expect each of the feature IDs in these cases to be separated
by \code{+}. For example, if a read overlaps with two exons, with IDs exon_1 and exon_2,
then the corresponding entry in a  column of exonic assignments would be "exon_1+exon_2".
The default expectation can be overwritten though and is thus not strictly enforced.
\item n: Number of reads with identical values for all other columns.
\item kinetic parameter estimates: These can be named whatever you would like as long as
they do not start with the string "se_". This should be reserved for kinetic parameter
uncertainties, if provided.
\item kinetic parameter uncertainties: Uncertainty in your kinetic parameter estimates.
These should be named "se_" followed by the kinetic parameter as its name appears in
the relevant column name of the \code{kinetics} table.
}}

\item{metadf}{Data frame detailing various aspects of each of the samples included
in the kinetics data frame. This includes:
\itemize{
\item \code{sample}: The sample ID, which should correspond to a sample ID in the provided kinetics data frame.
\item \code{tl}: Metabolic label time. There are several edge cases to be aware of:
\itemize{
\item If more than one metabolic label was used in the set of samples described
by the metadf (e.g., s4U and s6G were used), then the \code{tl} column should be
replaced by \verb{tl_<muttype>}, where \verb{<muttype>} represents the corresponding mutation
type referenced in the fractions that the label whose incubation time will be listed
in this column. For example, if feeding with s4U in some samples and s6G in others,
then performing standard nucleotide recoding chemistry, you will include
\code{tl_TC} and \code{tl_GA} columns corresponding to the s4U and s6G label times, respectively.
\item If a pulse-chase experimental design was used (!!this is strongly discouraged
unless you have a legitimate reason to prefer this design to a pulse-label
design!!), then you should have columns named \code{tpulse} and \code{tchase}, corresponding
to the pulse and chase times respectively. The same _\if{html}{\out{<muttype>}} convention should
be used in the case of multi-label pulse-chase designs.
}
\item sample characteristics: The remaining columns can be named whatever you like
and should include distinguishing features of groups of samples. Common columns might
include:
\itemize{
\item \code{treatment}: The experimental treatment applied to a set of samples.
This could represent things like genetic knockouts or knockdowns, drug treatments, etc.
\item \code{batch}: An ID for sets of samples that were collected and/or processed together.
Useful for regressing out technical batch effects
}
\item \code{assay}: This optional column should include a string that
describes the type of experiment that was done so as to influence
how EZbakR analyzes and interprets the data from those samples.
Possible values for \code{assay} currently include:
\itemize{
\item standard: Refers to the "standard" nucleotide recoding RNA-seq methods
(e.g., TimeLapse-seq, SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.), in which cells are fed with a
single metabolic label, RNA is extracted and sequenced, and mutations of a particular
type are counted
\item STL: Refers to Start-TimeLapse-seq, a method combining Start-seq (developed
by Karen Adelman's lab) with TimeLapse-seq. Used to infer the kinetics of
transcription initiation and promoter-proximal pause site departure.
\item TT: Refers to Transient-Transcriptome NR-seq, a method combining TT-seq (developed
by Patrick Cramer's lab) with NR-seq. TT-seq involves biochemically enriching
for labeled RNA. By combining this method with nucleotide recoding chemistry (as was
first done by the Simon lab with TT-TimeLapse-seq and has since been done with SLAM
chemistry, often referred to as TTchem-seq), it is possible to bioinformatically
filter out reads coming from unlabeled RNA background.
\item TILAC: Refers to TILAC, a method developed by the Simon lab to achieve
spike-in free normalization of RNA-seq data through the use of a dual labeling
approach inspired by the proteomic method SILAC.
\item subcellular: Refers to techniques such as subcellular TimeLapse-seq (developed
by Stirling Churchman's lab) which combine subcellular fractionation with
NR-seq to infer additional kinetic parameters.
\item sc: Refers to single-cell RNA-seq implementations of NR-seq.

\item{features}{Features tracked in \code{kinetics} data frame. Needs to be specified
explicitly as it cannot be automatically inferred.}

\item{name}{Optional; name to give to fractions table.}

\item{character_limit}{If name is chosen automatically, limit on the number of
characters in said name. If default name yields a string longer than this,
then kinetics table will be named \code{kinetics1}}
