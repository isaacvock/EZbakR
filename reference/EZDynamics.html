    <h2 id="arguments">Arguments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arguments"></a></h2>


<dl><dt id="arg-obj">obj<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-obj"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Currently must be an EZbakRData object on which <code>AverageAndRegularize</code>
has been run. In the future, will also support (in case where all species are
assayed in every sample) providing output of just <code><a href="EstimateFractions.html">EstimateFractions()</a></code> as input,
acting as a generalization of <code><a href="EstimateKinetics.html">EstimateKinetics()</a></code> in that case.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-graph">graph<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-graph"></a></dt>
<dd><p>An NxN adjacency matrix, where N represents the number of species
being modeled. One of these species must be called "0" and represent the "no RNA"
species. This is the species from which some species are synthesized (e.g., 0 -&gt; P,
means premature RNA is synthesized from no RNA), and the species to which
some species are degraded (e.g., M -&gt; 0 means mature RNA is converted to "no RNA"
via degradation). The rows and columns of this matrix must be the names of all
modled species, and rownames(graph) == colnames(graph). Entry i,j of the matrix
is either 0 if species i cannot be converted into species j under your model,
and an integer from 1:npars (where npars = total number of parameters to be
estimated) if it can.</p>
<p>For example, the model 0 -&gt; P -&gt; M -&gt; 0 would have the <code>graph</code>:
<code>matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE</code>.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-sub-features">sub_features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sub-features"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Which feature columns distinguish between the different
measured species? Note, the measured species need not have the same name,
and may not be directly equivalent to, the modeled species. The relationship
between the modeled species in <code>graph</code> and <code>sub_features</code> needs to be specified
in <code>modeled_to_measured</code> if the names are not equivalent though.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-grouping-features">grouping_features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-grouping-features"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Which features are the overarching feature assignments
by which <code>sub_features</code> should be grouped? This will usually be the feature
columns corresponding to full-gene assignments, as well as any higher order
assignments (e.g., chromosome). A <code>sub_feature</code> can be included in <code>grouping_features</code>
if it never has the value of <code>unassigned_name</code> ("__no_feature" by default). Only
one <code>sub_feature</code> should ever fulfill this criterion though.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-scale-factors">scale_factors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-scale-factors"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Data frame mapping samples to factors by which to multiply
read counts so as ensure proper normalization between different RNA populations.
Only relevant if you are modeling relationships between distinct RNA populations,
for example RNA from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Will eventually be inferred
automatically.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-sample-feature">sample_feature<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-sample-feature"></a></dt>
<dd><p>If different samples involve assaying different species,
this must be the name of the metadf column that distinguishes the different
classes of samples. For example, if analyzing a subcellular fractionation
dataset, you likely included a column in your metadf called "compartment".
This would then be your <code>sample_feature</code>, assuming you ran <code><a href="AverageAndRegularize.html">AverageAndRegularize()</a></code>,
with a <code>mean_formula</code> that included compartment as a term.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-modeled-to-measured">modeled_to_measured<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-modeled-to-measured"></a></dt>
<dd><p>If <code>sub_features</code> is not identical to the non "0"
species names in <code>graph</code>, then you must specify the relationship between
<code>sub_features</code>, <code>sample_feature</code> (if specified), and the species in <code>graph</code>.
This is done through a list of formulas, whose left side is a <code>sub_feature</code>
and whose right side is a function of species in <code>graph</code>. If <code>sample_feature</code>
is not specified, then <code>modeled_to_measured</code> should be a nameless list of
formulae. If <code>sample_feature</code> is specified, then <code>modeled_to_measured</code> must
be a named list of formulas where the names correspond to unique values of
<code>sample_feature</code>. In this latter case, the elements, should be the mapping
of measured features (<code>sub_features</code>) to modeled species (names in <code>graph</code>
that aren't "0").</p>
<p>For example, if your model is 0 -&gt; P -&gt; M -&gt; 0, where P stands for premature RNA
and M stands for mature RNA, and you have a column called
GF that corresponds to assignment anywhere in the gene, and XF that corresponds
to assignment of exclusively exon mapping reads, then your <code>modeled_to_measured</code>
should be <code>list(GF ~ P + M, XF ~ M).</code>.</p>
<p>As another example, if your model is 0 -&gt; N -&gt; C -&gt; 0, where N stands for
"nuclear RNA" and C stands for "cytoplasmic RNA", and your <code>sample_feature</code>
takes on values of "nuclear", "cytoplasmic", and "total", and you have a single
<code>sub_feature</code> called XF, then your <code>modeled_to_measured</code> shouild be
<code>list(nuclear = GF ~ N, cytoplasmic = GF ~ C, total = GF ~ C + N)</code>. This is
interpreted as meaning in groups of samples for which <code>sample_feature</code> == "nuclear",
reads assigned to a GF are from the N species (nuclear RNA). When
<code>sample_feature</code> == "cytoplasmic", reads assigned to GF correspond to the C
species (cytoplasmic RNA). When <code>sample_feature</code> == "total", reads assigned
to GF correspond to a combination of N and C (nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA).</p></dd>

<dt id="arg-avg-params-tokeep">avg_params_tokeep<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-avg-params-tokeep"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Names of parameters in averages table that you would
like to keep. Other parameters will be discarded. Don't include the prefixes "mean_",
"sd_", or "coverage_"; these will be imputed automatically. In other words,
this should be the base parameter names.</p></dd>

<dt id="arg-fraction-design">fraction_design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-fraction-design"></a></dt>
<dd><p>"Design matrix" specifying which RNA populations exist
in your samples. By default, this will be created automatically and will assume
that all combinations of the <code>mutrate_populations</code> you have requested to analyze are
present in your data. If this is not the case for your data, then you will have
to create one manually. See docs for <code>EstimateFractions</code> (run ?EstimateFractions()) for more details.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-parameter">parameter<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-parameter"></a></dt>

by default.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-feature-lengths">feature_lengths<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-feature-lengths"></a></dt>
<dd><p>Table of effective lengths for each feature combination in your

should be a data frame with columns GF, XF, and length.</p></dd>


<dt id="arg-use-coverage">use_coverage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arg-use-coverage"></a></dt>

<dd><p>List mapping individual RNA species in <code>graph</code> to
different sample_feature values (sf). This is relevant if you are modeling both
pre- and mature RNA dynamics in subcellular fractionation data. EZbakR can usually
automatically infer this, but if not, then you can manually specify this mapping.
Should be a list with one element per unique sample_feature type. Each element should
be a vector of the RNA species in <code>graph</code> that belong to that sample_feature type. For
example, if you have whole cell, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fraction data, this should have
one element called "cytoplasmic" and one element called "nuclear". The whole cell
sample_feature is a sum of cytoplasmic and nuclear and thus does not apply. The "cytoplasmic"
element of this list should be the set of RNA species that are present in the cytoplasm,
e.g. cytoplasmic pre-RNA (maybe referred to in <code>graph</code> as CP) and cytoplasmic mature
RNA (maybe referred to in <code>graph</code> as CM).</p></dd>

    <p><code>EZbakRData</code> object with an additional "dynamics" table.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section level2">
    <h2 id="details">Details<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#details"></a></h2>
    <p>When running <code><a href="AverageAndRegularize.html">AverageAndRegularize()</a></code> to produce input for <code>EZDynamics()</code>, you
must set <code>parameter</code> to "logit_fraction_high<muttype>" (<muttype> = type of mutation
modeled by <code><a href="EstimateFractions.html">EstimateFractions()</a></code>, e.g., TC). If you have multiple distinct label times,
you must also include the label time (<code>tl</code> of your <code>metadf</code>)
in your regression formula. <code>EZDynamics()</code> models the logit(fraction high &lt;muttype),
and this will depend on the label time (longer label time = higher fraction), which
is why these two conditions must be met. If you only have a single label time though,
<code>EZDynamics</code> will be able to impute this one value for all samples from your <code>metadf</code>.
You can also include additional interaction terms in your <code><a href="AverageAndRegularize.html">AverageAndRegularize()</a></code>
model for different experimental conditions in which experiments were conducted,
so that inferred kinetic parameters can be compared across these conditions. Currently,
more complex modeling beyond simple stratification of samples by one or more condition
is not possible with <code>EZDynamics()</code>.</muttype></muttype></p>
<p>For normalization purposes, especially if analyzing pre-mRNA processing dynamics,
you will need to provide <code><a href="AverageAndRegularize.html">AverageAndRegularize()</a></code> with a table of feature lengths
via the <code>feature_lengths</code> parameter. This will be used in all cases to length
normalize read counts. Even in the case when you are just modeling mature mRNA
dynamics, this is technically necessary for accurate estimation of scale factors.</p>
<p>The first step of <code>EZDynamics()</code> is attempted inference of normalization scale
factors for read counts. If you have scale factors you calculated yourself,
e.g. via specialized spike-in protocols, you can provide these via the <code>scale_factors</code>
parameter. If not, <code>EZDynamics()</code> will try to infer these from the fraction labeled's
in each <code>sample_feature</code> (e.g., in different subcellular compartments). This relies on
having some <code>sample_feature</code>'s that are a combination of other <code>sample_feature</code>'s. For
example, if analyzing subcellular fractionation data, you may have 1) total RNA; 2)
cytoplasmic RNA; and 3) nuclear RNA. Total RNA = cytoplasmic + nuclear RNA, and thus
the fraction of reads from labeled RNA is a function of the total cytoplasmic and
nuclear fraction labeled's, as well as the relative molecular abundances of cytoplasmic
and nuclear RNA. The latter is precisely the scale factors we need to estimate.
If you do not have sufficient combinations of data to perform this scale factor estimation,
<code>EZDynamics()</code> will only use the fraction labeled's for modeling kinetic parameters.
It can then perform post-hoc normalization to estimate a single synthesis rate constant,
using the downstream rate constants to infer the unknown normalization scale factor necessary
to combine kinetic parameter estimates and read counts to infer this rate constant.</p>
<p>For estimating kinetic parameters, <code>EZDynamics()</code> infers the solution of the linear
system of ODEs specified in your <code>graph</code> matrix input. This is done by representing
the system of equations as a matrix, and deriving the general solution of the levels
of each modeled species of RNA from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.
While this makes <code>EZDynamics()</code> orders of magnitude more efficient than if it had to
numerically infer the solution for each round of optimization, needing to compute
eigenvalues and eigenvectors in each optimization iteration is still non-trivial,
meaning that <code>EZDynamics()</code> may take anywhere from 10s of minutes to a couple hours
to run, depending on how complex your model is and how many distinct set of samples
and experimental conditions you have.</p>
